# Chapter 5 - Collection Mapping (p. 107)

Collections of Entites, Embeddables and basic types are supported.
Collections of Embeddables and basic types are not relationships, but **element collections**
The difference is in the used annotations: element collections use the **@ElementCollection** annotations

@ElementCollectiom can define the fetch type.
